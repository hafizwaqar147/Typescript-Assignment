//Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.
let famous_person = "Oscar Wilde";
let massege = `“You don't love someone for their looks, or their clothes, or for their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear.”`;

let massege2 = `You don't love someone for their looks, or their clothes, or for their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear.`;

console.log(famous_person + ` said, ` + massege);

console.log(`${famous_person} said, ${massege}`);

console.log(`${famous_person + ` said,`} ${massege}`);

console.log(`${famous_person} said, "${massege2}"`);
